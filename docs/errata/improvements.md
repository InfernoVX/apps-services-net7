## Page 72 - Executing stored procedures using ADO.NET

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 31 December 2022](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/3).

In Step 2, I wrote, "In your preferred database tool, add a new stored procedure. For example, if you are using 
SQL Server Management Studio, then right-click Stored Procedures and select Add New Stored Procedure."

It would be better to add an extra step, "In your preferred database tool, add a new stored procedure. For example, if you are using SQL Server Management Studio, then **expand the Programmability node,** right-click Stored Procedures, and select Add New Stored Procedure."

# Bonus Content
